# Movies-Flix

This project grabs movies that are currently now playing on theater and allows users to like/dislike, watch trailers and read information about the movie.

Written in: ReactJs
Used: Toastify for notifications, axios for routing.

The reason I decided to do this was because I am learning React and this is one of the projects that taught me how to correctly use an API, a flow of pages, hooks, routes and components.
